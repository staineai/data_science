Hello and welcome to my data science repository! This repo is where I keep projects that I feel truly highlight my skills as a data scientist. In it you will find a collection of projects in multiple coding languages and covering topics from machine learning to data visualization. 

<strong>Project Highlight:</strong> Automated Outliers & Eaches per UOM Detection Model <br>
I am particularly proud of this project because it was my first "real world" machine learning project. Data analysts at Lumere are finding that they need clean up more and more data in less and less time. This model allows data analysts to detect anomolies in Lumere's client purchase order data using a random forest model. It also has some other really cool features!
